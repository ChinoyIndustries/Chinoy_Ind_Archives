    <!--crc: this is an item from the vertical file in my personal library of railroad documents and
    books that I've collected. it's a typewritten history of the locomotives of a particular railroad,
    which I found a month ago at a flea market, loose on a table, with absolutely no attribution on
    it whatsoever. I typed it up into a word document the next day without any particular plan for
    how to publish it, but it made for a really convenient thing to use for this homework assignment.
    Most of the items I've digitized so far are just scanned images.-->
